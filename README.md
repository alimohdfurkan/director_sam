This is a simple Instagram-style web page for displaying 6 images and their stories, designed for GitHub Pages or any static hosting.

## How to use

1. Place your image files in the same folder:
   - `1.jpeg`, `2.jpeg`, `3.jpeg`, `4.jpeg`, `5.jpeg`, `6.jpeg` (these will show as main posts)
   - `background.jpeg` (this will show as the page background)
2. Edit `script.js` if you want to change the stories or dates shown under each image.
3. Deploy the files (`pic_uploader.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`, your images) to your GitHub repo.
